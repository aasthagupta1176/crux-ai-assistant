Crux is a full-stack AI-powered voice assistant developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to interact with a web interface through voice commands, creating a more intuitive and hands-free user experience. By integrating speech recognition and text-to-speech technology via the Web Speech API, the assistant can listen to spoken input, process the request using backend logic, and respond aloud. The backend communicates with AI models such as Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT API to generate smart and relevant responses. This makes the assistant capable of answering questions, opening websites, or performing custom user-defined actions. The frontend is built with React for dynamic user interaction, while the backend uses Express.js to handle API routes and connect with the AI services. MongoDB is used to store user interactions or command history if needed. The project demonstrates real-time voice interaction in the browser and showcases how modern technologies can be combined to build intelligent, interactive web applications. This assistant can be deployed online using platforms like Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend, making it accessible from anywhere.
